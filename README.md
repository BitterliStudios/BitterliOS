# BitterliOS
BitterliOS is my website, a clone of a windows 98 interface but tailored to my brand. This features a basic media player, desktop and theme interface.

## About the project
I started this back in September os 2020 because I was bored. My website also needed a face lift (you can see it at http://bitterli.us). I have been using that same code since 2017 and decided to finally phase to a new looking website.

## Features
The website features an information center window, folders, audio player, video player and theme selector. These windows appear at the bottom of the page in the toolbar. The windows are also closeable and moveable. The toolbar tabs also updae accordingly. The theme selector allows the user to change the background of their page to the available backgrounds. We also feature multimedia playback, with media playback controls as well as volume sliders. There is also a start menu with varing programs and links to my social media pages.

## Ultimate goal
To have a semi-operational windows 98 clone site to house my works and social links. Allow the users to explore the website and find hidden items, play games and explore my various forms of content.


### I have provided more information about the project on the wiki. Over there, I go into much more detail like plans, release dates and stuff like that.
